  🎲 DICE GAME - GITHUB DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
====================================================

📋 PREREQUISITES:
-----------------
1. GitHub account (you already have this ✅)
2. Git installed on your computer

   Check if Git is installed:
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Type: git --version
   - If you see a version number, you're good!
   - If not, download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win


🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS (EASIEST METHOD):
--------------------------------------

STEP 1: Create Repository on GitHub
   1. Go to: https://github.com/new
   2. Repository name: vibetest (or whatever you want)
   3. Description: "A dice-based board game with RPG elements"
   4. Make it PUBLIC (required for free GitHub Pages)
   5. ❌ Do NOT check "Add a README file"
   6. ❌ Do NOT add .gitignore or license yet
   7. Click "Create repository"

STEP 2: Run the Deployment Script
   1. Go to: D:\Files\Desktop\Claude\Projects\DiceGameTest
   2. Double-click: deploy-to-github.bat
   3. Follow the prompts:
      - Enter your GitHub username
      - Enter repository name (or press Enter for "vibetest")
      - Confirm you created the repository
   4. You may be asked to login to GitHub
      - Enter your GitHub username
      - For password, use a Personal Access Token (see below)

STEP 3: Enable GitHub Pages
   The script will open the settings page automatically, or:
   1. Go to your repository on GitHub
   2. Click "Settings" tab
   3. Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
   4. Under "Source", select "main" branch
   5. Click "Save"
   6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

STEP 4: Play Your Game!
   After GitHub Pages is enabled:
   - V1 (Single Player): https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/vibetest/v1/
   - V2 (Type System): https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/vibetest/v2/

   Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username!


🔐 GITHUB AUTHENTICATION:
--------------------------
If you're asked for a password when pushing, you need a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Note: "vibetest Deployment"
4. Expiration: "No expiration" (or choose a duration)
5. Scopes: Check "repo" (this gives full control of repositories)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. COPY THE TOKEN (you won't see it again!)
8. Use this token as your password when git asks


📝 UPDATING YOUR GAME:
-----------------------
After making changes to your game:

1. Open Command Prompt in the project folder
2. Run these commands:

   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated game with new features"
   git push

3. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
4. Refresh your game URL


❓ TROUBLESHOOTING:
-------------------

Problem: "git is not recognized"
Solution: Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win

Problem: "remote: Repository not found"
Solution: Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first

Problem: "Authentication failed"
Solution: Use a Personal Access Token instead of your password (see above)

Problem: "GitHub Pages not working"
Solution:
   - Make sure repository is PUBLIC
   - Check Settings → Pages is enabled with "main" branch
   - Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling

Problem: Game shows 404 error
Solution:
   - Make sure you include /v1/ or /v2/ in the URL
   - Check that index.html exists in the v1 or v2 folder


🎉 ALTERNATIVE: NETLIFY (NO GIT NEEDED):
-----------------------------------------
If GitHub seems too complicated:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the "v1" or "v2" folder onto the page
3. Get instant URL!
4. Sign up to keep it permanent
